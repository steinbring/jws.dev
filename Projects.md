# Projects

Like many professional web developers, most of what I write is not public and is the property of my employer.  The projects listed below are side projects (stuff written for fun).

## Websites
* I created [Joe's Job Tracker](https://joes-job-tracker.web.app/) as a bit of a proof of concept during the [October 2023 Hack and Tell](https://hackandtell.rocks/events/2023-10/). It is mainly a proof of concept but it also replaces a spreadsheet that I was using at work to track active jobs.  It uses Vue 3, Vue Composables, Firebase Cloud Firestore, and Google SSO.

## Android Applications
* [Once upon a time](https://github.com/steinbring?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=archived&language=), I wrote a number of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) / [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) / [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) apps.  The code is [still on GitHub](https://github.com/steinbring/PocketSteinbring) but it hasn't been updated in years and the apps are not available on the play store anymore.

## Publications

* I post coding-related stuff to [blog.jws](https://blog.jws.app/category/coding/) and [DEV](https://dev.to/steinbring/).  [Blog.jws](https://blog.jws.app/category/coding/) also contains a lot of non-coding content.
