# Projects

Like many professional web developers, most of what I write is not public and is the property of my employer.  The projects listed below are side projects (stuff written for fun).

## Websites
* In addition to this website, I also have [jws.app](https://jws.app).  Where [jws.dev](https://jws.dev) is using [a static site generator](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [jws.app](https://jws.app) is all scratch built.  [Jws.app](https://jws.app) is meant as a place to [play with some concepts](https://blog.jws.app/tag/jws-app/).
* I am working on building an app to explore Wisconsin State Parks.  You can follow my [progress on the blog](https://blog.jws.app/tag/state-parks-app/).

## Android Applications
* [Once upon a time](https://github.com/steinbring?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=archived&language=), I wrote a number of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) / [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) / [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/) apps.  The code is [still on GitHub](https://github.com/steinbring/PocketSteinbring) but it hasn't been updated in years and the apps are not available on the play store anymore.

## Publications

* I post coding-related stuff to [blog.jws](https://blog.jws.app/category/coding/) and [DEV](https://dev.to/steinbring/).  [Blog.jws](https://blog.jws.app/category/coding/) also contains a lot of non-coding content.
