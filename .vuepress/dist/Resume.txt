QM Quality Matters

Jan 2015 - June 2016: Application Developer

* I mainly worked on the MyQM, CRMS, and MyCR systems.
* The systems were custom built using ColdFusion and MS SQL Server. The client-side code that they used when I got there was using a lot of jQuery. I introduced them to Rivets.js and rewrote a lot of their dashboards to use it.
* The organization funds itself through sales of memberships, so most of my work isn't publicly accessible.

* I mainly made systems that allowed Starkmedia's clients to update their own websites. Clients that I worked with included Red Arrow, Artisan Partners, Mandel Group, and Calf-Tel. Very few of my projects were greenfield but I was able to introduce some innovations and tweak how things were done.
  * Starkmedia mainly used ColdFusion and MS SQL Server. I introduced AngularJS 1.x, PhoneGap, and Git into the organization while I was there.
