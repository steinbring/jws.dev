# Resources

## What is this?

Every now and then, I find something interesting that I want to share.

## Web and Application Development

### Software

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) -- This has been my go-to code editor for the past 10yrs.  I am sticking with v3 for a little while.
- [Navicat](https://navicat.com/en) -- This has been my go-to database client for the past few years. It is just kind of expensive
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) -- Great budget alternative to [Navicat](https://navicat.com/en)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) -- Good alternative to [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) -- API client that is pretty good when building out your back-end

- [MindMac](https://mindmac.app/) -- I think that this is a better alternative to [Ollamac](https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac) and [MacGPT](https://www.macgpt.com/). It is a graphical interface for both Ollama and ChatGPT. It can also do image generation using things like Dall-E.
