# Resources

## What is this?

Every now and then, I find something interesting that I want to share.

## Web and Application Development

### Software

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) -- This has been my go-to code editor for the past 10yrs.  I am sticking with v3 for a little while.
- [Navicat](https://navicat.com/en) -- This has been my go-to database client for the past few years. It is just kind of expensive
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) -- Great budget alternative to [Navicat](https://navicat.com/en)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) -- Good alternative to [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) -- API client that is pretty good when building out your back-end
- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) -- My go-to markdown editor
- [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/) -- How I use my iPad as a second monitor for work (Yes, I know that [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380) exists)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) -- A really good upgrade from the native macOS terminal
- [CSV to JSON / JSON to CSV Converter](https://apps.apple.com/ma/app/csv-json-two-way-converter/id1608602049) -- Worth the $4 if you need to convert a large JSON file to CSV
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) -- A good way of running LLMs locally on your mac

- [Ollamac](https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac) -- A graphical Ollama client for the mac
- [MindMac](https://mindmac.app/) -- I think that this is a better alternative to [Ollamac](https://github.com/kevinhermawan/Ollamac) and [MacGPT](https://www.macgpt.com/). It is a graphical interface for both Ollama and ChatGPT. It can also do image generation using things like Dall-E.
- [Ollama Web UI](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui) -- A ChatGPT-Style Web Interface for Ollama that runs locally in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
