# My Experience

## Python

- I have [published code on my blog](https://jws.news/tag/python/) related to [Machine Learning (ML)](https://jws.news/tag/machine-learning/) and [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://jws.news/tag/ai/).  Python might be my chosen language for [AI](https://jws.news/tag/AI/) and [ML](https://jws.news/tag/machine-learning/) work.

## JavaScript

- I have years of experience with [AngularJS](https://jws.news/tag/AngularJS/), [Rivets.js](https://jws.news/tag/rivets-js/), [Vue.js](https://jws.news/tag/Vue-JS/), and [React](https://jws.news/tag/React/).  I also have years of experience writing [Node.js](https://jws.news/tag/node-js/) in multiple contexts.

### AngularJS

- In 2013, I introduced my employer to AngularJS, began teaching my fellow developers about its promise for what it could do for us, and started using it with production applications.
- In 2014 and 2015, I [wrote several articles about how to best leverage AngularJS](https://jws.news/tag/angularjs/) and wrote several small projects using it.

### Rivets.js

- I discovered Rivets.js in 2015 after joining a new shop.  Their product needed a binding and templating solution and I couldn't justify adding AngularJS to it.  Rivets was lightweight and robust enough to fit the need since it is only 6.2kb minified and gzipped (including dependencies).
- I [published several articles on Rivets in 2015 and 2016](https://jws.news/tag/rivets-js/) and presented about it at [MilwaukeeJS](https://www.meetup.com/milwaukeejs/).

### Vue.js

- When I joined my next shop in 2016, I discovered Vue.js and wished I had known about it sooner.  It was everything that I wanted from Rivets and more.
- I have published [dozens of articles on Vue.js since 2020](https://jws.news/tag/vue-js/) and written [both side apps](https://boilerplate.jws.app/) and code for work using it.  I adore it.

### React

- In 2024, I poked my head up and realized that React dominates the space, now.  I started exploring the topic and [published several articles on it](https://jws.news/tag/react/).

### Node.js

- Since 2014, I have written Node for multiple shops in multiple contexts.  I have run it in [Heroku](https://jws.news/tag/heroku/), [Azure](https://jws.news/tag/azure/), and [Google Cloud](https://jws.news/tag/google-cloud/).  For one client, I ran it in [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/functions-and-firebase).  I like it a lot.

## PHP

- I have years of experience writing [PHP](https://jws.news/tag/php/), including [Laravel](https://jws.news/tag/laravel/).  I also have a decade of experience with [WordPress](https://jws.news/tag/wordpress/).

## .NET

- I was the .NET expert at BR.  We used both .NET Framework and .NET Classic.

## CSS

- I have 15 years of experience writing [CSS](https://jws.news/tag/css/).

## SQL

- I have 15 years of experience writing SQL.

## HTML

- I have 15 years of experience writing HTML.

## Relational Databases

- I have experience with Oracle RDBMS, MySQL / MariaDB, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

## NoSQL Databases

- I have experience with [CouchDB](https://jws.news/tag/couchdb/), [MongoDB](https://jws.news/tag/mongodb/), [Firebase](https://jws.news/tag/firebase/), and [Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://jws.news/tag/firebase/).  I think that Cloud Firestore is my favorite.

## Vector Databases

- I have experience with Chroma DB in the context of embedding

## Web Components

- I have experience with [web components](https://jws.news/tag/web-components/) with and without [Lit](https://jws.news/tag/lit/).  I like Lit.

## Artificial Intelligence

### Ollama

- I introduced [Ollama](https://jws.news/tag/Ollama/) to BR and used it to help them develop an embedding solution.
- I have written many articles on [how to integrate it into your Node.js and Python systems](https://jws.news/tag/ollama/).
- I am presenting a "Crafting Intelligent Python Apps with Retrieval-Augmented Generation" webinar on May 31, 2024, and June 28, 2024.

### ChatGPT

- I have used [ChatGPT](https://jws.news/tag/ChatGPT/)'s APIs to develop [a personal project](https://botsin.space/@MKELimerick).
