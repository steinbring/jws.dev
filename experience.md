# My Experience

## Python

- I have [published code on my blog](https://jws.news/tag/python/) related to [Machine Learning (ML)](https://jws.news/tag/machine-learning/) and [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://jws.news/tag/ai/).  Python might be my chosen language for [AI](https://jws.news/tag/AI/) and [ML](https://jws.news/tag/machine-learning/) work.

## JavaScript

- I have years of experience with [AngularJS](https://jws.news/tag/AngularJS/), [Rivets.js](https://jws.news/tag/rivets-js/), [Vue.js](https://jws.news/tag/Vue-JS/), and [React](https://jws.news/tag/React/).  I also have years of experience writing [Node.js](https://jws.news/tag/node-js/) in multiple contexts.

### AngularJS

- In 2013, I introduced my employer to AngularJS, began teaching my fellow developers about its promise for what it could do for us, and started using it with production applications.
- In 2014 and 2015, I [wrote several articles about how to leverage AngularJS best](https://jws.news/tag/angularjs/) and wrote several small projects using it.

### Rivets.js

- I discovered Rivets.js in 2015 after joining a new shop.  Their product needed a binding and templating solution and I couldn't justify adding AngularJS to it.  Rivets was lightweight and robust enough to fit the need since it is only 6.2kb minified and gzipped (including dependencies).
- I [published several articles on Rivets in 2015 and 2016](https://jws.news/tag/rivets-js/) and presented about it at [MilwaukeeJS](https://www.meetup.com/milwaukeejs/).

### Vue.js

- When I joined my next shop in 2016, I discovered Vue.js and wished I had known about it sooner.  It was everything that I wanted from Rivets and more.
- I have published [dozens of articles on Vue.js since 2020](https://jws.news/tag/vue-js/) and written [both side apps](https://boilerplate.jws.app/) and code for work using it.  I adore it.

### React

- In 2024, I poked my head up and realized React dominates the space.  I started exploring the topic and [published several articles on it](https://jws.news/tag/react/).

### Node.js

- Since 2014, I have written Node for multiple shops in multiple contexts.  I have run it in [Heroku](https://jws.news/tag/heroku/), [Azure](https://jws.news/tag/azure/), and [Google Cloud](https://jws.news/tag/google-cloud/).  For one client, I ran it in [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/functions-and-firebase).  I like it a lot.

## PHP

- I have written a ton of PHP while at [Starkmedia](https://jws.dev/resume.html#senior-application-developer), [UW-Milwaukee](https://jws.dev/resume.html#web-application-engineer), and [Bader Rutter](https://jws.dev/resume.html#senior-full-stack-developer).
- I have also written dozens of [PHP articles on my website](https://jws.news/tag/php/) and on [Dev](https://dev.to/steinbring).

### Laravel

- I started writing Laravel while working for [UW-Milwaukee](https://jws.dev/resume.html#web-application-engineer).
- I started [writing about Laravel](https://jws.news/tag/laravel/) in 2022 while attempting to convince [Bader Rutter](https://jws.dev/resume.html#senior-full-stack-developer) to consider it.

### WordPress

- I built and maintained WordPress sites at [Starkmedia](https://jws.dev/resume.html#senior-application-developer), [UW-Milwaukee](https://jws.dev/resume.html#web-application-engineer), and [Bader Rutter](https://jws.dev/resume.html#senior-full-stack-developer).
- [My own website](https://jws.news/) uses WordPress and has used it for over a decade.

## .NET

## CFML

### Adobe ColdFusion

- I wrote a ton of CFML at [UW-Milwaukee](https://jws.dev/resume.html#web-application-developer), [Kohler](https://jws.dev/resume.html#coldfusion-developer), [Starkmedia](https://jws.dev/resume.html#senior-application-developer), and [QM Quality Matters](https://jws.dev/resume.html#application-developer).
- I have written a few [ColdFusion blog posts](https://jws.news/tag/coldfusion/) but not as many as you would expect.

### Lucee

- If you don't have $8,000 for an Adobe ColdFusion license, Lucee is a great option.  I have used it a lot to play around with CFML outside of work.

## CSS

- In early 2024, I wrote [an app](https://boilerplate.jws.app/) [that uses Vue, Pinia, the composition API, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://jws.news/2024/wrote-a-thing-with-vue-and-firebase/).  The plan was to use it as a "boilerplate" for other things.

## Vector Databases
