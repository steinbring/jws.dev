	* [Glendale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Wisconsin) is a lovely place to live.

	* I have written a lot of [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language) since 2006.
		* I do not recommend that anybody install [Adobe ColdFusion](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) when [Lucee](https://lucee.org/) is available.

		* [VuePress](https://blog.jws.app/tag/vuepress/) (what this site uses)
		* [Bulma](https://blog.jws.app/tag/bulma/) (I had issues with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) previously)
		* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
		* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
	* I tend to enjoy front-end development more than back-end development.
