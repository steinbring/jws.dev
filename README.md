## Who am I?

* I live in [Glendale, Wisconsin](http://www.glendale-wi.org/).
	* It is a suburb of [Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/).
	* [Glendale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Wisconsin) is a lovely place to live.
* I am a habitual hobby collector ([photography](https://pixelfed.social/steinbring), motorcycling, lock picking, etc).
* I have two [dogs](https://jws.news/tag/dogs/) and a [cat](https://jws.news/tag/cat/).
* I enjoy [international travel](TravelGoals.html).
	* I enjoy travel hacking, too (it is how I afford the trip).
	* I plan on seeing Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea in 2024.
* I am a web application developer.
	* I am looking for a job in web application development or machine learning in Milwaukee or remote.
	* I worked for [Bader Rutter](https://baderrutter.com/) from July 2021 until February 2024.
		* BR clients included Zoetis, Corteva Agriscience, Douglas Products, and McCain Foods.
		* I served on an AI working group where I introduced the agency to Ollama.

	* I previously worked for [QM Quality Matters](https://www.qualitymatters.org/), [Starkmedia](https://www.starkmedia.com/), [Experis](http://www.experis.com/), and [UWM](https://uwm.edu).
	* I have written a lot of [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language) since 2006.
		* I do not recommend that anybody install [Adobe ColdFusion](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) when [Lucee](https://lucee.org/) is available.
		* I don't do [ColdFusion](https://cfdocs.org/) anymore.
	* These days (at work) I use:

		* [Firebase](https://jws.news/tag/firebase/)
		* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)

	* When I write code for fun, I mainly use:
		* [Vue.JS](https://jws.news/tag/vue-js/)
		* [Python](https://jws.news/tag/python/)
  		* [Firebase](https://jws.news/tag/firebase/)
  		* [Shoelace](https://jws.news/tag/web-awesome/)
		* [WordPress](https://jws.news/tag/wordpress/)
  		* [Lit](https://jws.news/tag/lit/)
    	* [Ollama](https://jws.news/tag/ollama/)
	* I tend to enjoy front-end development more than back-end development.
* In 2005, I received a BBA in Management Information Systems from the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee - Lubar School of Business](https://uwm.edu/business/).
* In 2012, I received an MBA from [Cardinal Stritch University](https://stritch.edu/).
* Conferences that I was at in 2024:
	* [Cyphercon 7.0](https://cyphercon.com/)
* I post to [my blog](https://jws.news/) fairly often.
	* It tends to be 80% coding topics and 20% other topics.
	* Posts traditionally go up on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
* I am a Lord under the house of Pierpont-Archer per [LordJosephSteinbringCertificate.pdf](/pdf/LordJosephSteinbringCertificate.pdf), I guess.
* If you want to send me money for something, you can use: [https://paypal.me/joesteinbring](https://paypal.me/joesteinbring) or [https://account.venmo.com/u/Joe-Steinbring](https://account.venmo.com/u/Joe-Steinbring)
