## Who am I?

	* It is a subburb of [Milwaukee](https://city.milwaukee.gov/).
	* [Glendale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Wisconsin) is a lovely place to live.

	* I have written a lot of [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language) since 2006.
		* I do not recommend that anybody install [Adobe ColdFusion](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) when [Lucee](https://lucee.org/) is available.

		* [Bulma](https://blog.jws.app/tag/bulma/) (I had issues with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) previously)
		* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
		* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
	* I tend to enjoy front-end development more than back-end development. ;)
* In 2005, I recieved a BBA in Management Information Systems from the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee - Lubar School of Business](https://uwm.edu/business/).
* In 2012, I recieved a MBA from [Cardinal Stritch University](https://www.stritch.edu/academics/programs/badgm).
